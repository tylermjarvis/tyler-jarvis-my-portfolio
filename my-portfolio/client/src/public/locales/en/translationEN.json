  "Intro": {
    "1": "I am currently studying Full Stack Development. I would like to delve more into the front-end, as I enjoy the creative side of creating an appealing and unique browser, as well as the challenges and rewards that come from communicating with customers. I enjoy creating React projects with a MERN Stack, teaching myself Shopify, with my customised Shopify site and working on my Unity game using C#."

  "AboutMe": {
    "1": "I have a Bachelor of Communications, majoring in Digital Media and minoring in Advertising. I first started working in Marketing and Customer Service, but have recently been travelling the world working in Australia at a resort and a cattle station. I also worked on a super yacht in the Mediterranean Sea and was the House Manager at a private estate in Guernsey. I am very good at adapting to new situation and environments and am familiar withn a change in scenery. I have decided to come back to my Digital Media background and add to my skills of Web Development. When I am not coding, I am delving into the French language and keeping the time on the drums."
